# JiraPresentationTool - Unified Menu & Scripts

![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7%2B-blue)
![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

This project was inspired by a script a colleague had created, but that solution did not completely suit my wishes. I started by building the presentation functionality, and from there the toolkit evolved into a unified terminal menu (`jpt_menu.py`) to run a suite of Jira automation and reporting scripts for sprint management, notifications, sanity checks, and forecasting.

### 3. Check 'To Refine' Stories & Epics (Sanity Check) (`jira_refine_sanity_check.py`)
- **Purpose:** Checks all Epics and Stories in 'To Refine' state for missing labels and acceptance criteria.
- **Instructions:**
  - Acceptance criteria must be a markdown list in the custom field.
  - Results are grouped by Epic.

- [See detailed README](./jira_blocked_overview.md)

### 7. Forecast Next Sprint Capacity (Excel Export) (`jpt_forecast.py`)
- **Purpose:** Fetches last 10 sprints, calculates achieved points/time, prompts for team availability, and forecasts next sprint's capacity.
- **Instructions:**
  - Exports results and forecast to Excel, appending new sprints only, with trend charts.
  - Close the Excel file before running.
- [See detailed README](./jpt_forecast.md)

     export JT_JIRA_USERNAME="your-email@domain.com"
     export JT_JIRA_PASSWORD="your-jira-api-token"
     export JT_JIRA_BOARD="<board-id>"  # Use the board *number*, not the board name!

## How to Find Custom Field IDs in Jira

To work with custom fields (such as acceptance criteria) in scripts or API calls, you often need the custom field's internal ID (e.g., `customfield_12345`). You can find these IDs using the Jira REST API:

1. **Get issue JSON via API:**
   - Open an issue in your browser and add `?expand=names` to the URL, or use `curl`:
     ```sh
     curl -u your-email@domain.com:your-jira-api-token \
       -H "Accept: application/json" \
       "https://<your-domain>.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/<ISSUE-KEY>?expand=names"
     ```
2. **Inspect the JSON output:**
   - Look for the `fields` section. Custom fields will appear as keys like `customfield_XXXXX`.
   - The `names` section maps these IDs to their human-readable names.

3. **More info:**
   - See the [Jira Cloud REST API Reference](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/intro/#version) for details.
